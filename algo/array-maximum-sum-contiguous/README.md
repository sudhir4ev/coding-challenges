# Maximum Sum in Contiguous Array

`Medium` `#25mins`

Given an array of integers `numbers`, determine the subarray that has the highest sum and return that sum.

A subarray is a contiguous segment of an array where all elements are taken from consecutive indices, preserving their order, such as `[2, 3]` in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, while non-contiguous selections like [1, 3] are not valid subarray.

### Input
-  `numbers: number[]`: An array of integers

### Examples

```
Input: numbers = [-1,5,-3,9,-11]
Output: 11
Explanation: The subarray [5, -3, 9] has the largest sum i.e 11.
```
```
Input: numbers = [9]
Output: 9
Explanation: The single-element subarray [9] has the largest sum i.e 9.
```
```
Input: numbers = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 10
Explanation: The subarray [1,2,3,4] has the largest sum i.e 10.
```

### Constraints
- 1 <= `numbers.length` <= 10,000
- -10,000 <= `numbers[i]` <= 10,000
