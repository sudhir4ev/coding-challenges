# Is the Graph a Tree

`#Medium` `#15mins` `#Graphs` `#DepthFirstSearch` `#UnionFind`

Consider a graph with `num` nodes, labeled from `0` to `num - 1`. Given `num` and a list of edges where each `edges[i] = [a, b]` represents an undirected connection between nodes `a` and `b`, determine whether the provided edges form a valid tree.

A **[valid tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(abstract_data_type))** is a connected, acyclic graph that spans all `num` nodes. This means:

1. All nodes must be reachable from any other node
2. The graph must not contain any cycles
3. The graph must have exactly `num - 1` edges, where `num` is the number of nodes

Return `true` if the edges form a valid tree; otherwise, return `false`.

### Input

- `num: number`: Number of nodes in the graph
- `edges: Array<[number, number]>`: A 2D array where `edges[i] = [a, b]` represents an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`

### Examples

```
Input: num = 5, edges = [[3,4],[0,3],[1,2],[0,1]]
Output: true
Explanation: The graph consists of 5 nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) connected by 4 edges. All nodes are reachable from any other node, and there are no cycles. The graph has exactly num - 1 = 4 edges, satisfying the conditions for a valid tree.
```

```
Input: num = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4]]
Output: false
Explanation: Although all nodes are connected, the graph contains a cycle (e.g., 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1), which violates the condition of being acyclic. Hence, the graph is not a valid tree.
```

```
Input: num = 3, edges = [[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: The graph consists of 3 nodes (0, 1, 2), but only 1 edge is provided. This leaves node 2 disconnected, violating the condition of being connected. Hence, the graph is not a valid tree.
```

### Constraints

- 1 <= `num` <= 1000
- 1 <= `edges.length` <= 1000
- `edges[i].length` == 2
- 0 <= `a`, `b` < `num`
- `a != b`
- There are no self-loops or repeated edges
