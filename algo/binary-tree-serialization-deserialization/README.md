# Binary Tree Serialization and Deserialization

`#Hard` `#20mins` `#Trees` `#DepthFirstSearch` `#BreadthFirstSearch`

Design a method to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There are no specific constraints on how the serialization and deserialization should be implemented; the key requirement is that the serialized binary tree must be convertible back into the original tree structure.

The binary tree is represented by a collection of `TreeNode`s, where each node has optional `left` and `right` child nodes, which are also `TreeNode`s.

A `TreeNode` has the following interface:

```ts
interface TreeNode {
  val: number;
  left: TreeNode | null;
  right: TreeNode | null;
}
```

### Input

- `serializeBinaryTree`
  - `root: TreeNode`: Root node of the tree. Examples display a level-order traversal of the tree
- `deserializeBinaryTree`
  - `data: string`: String representation of the tree. The format is up to you to design

### Examples

```
Input: root = [5,3,8,1,4,6,9]
Output: [5,3,8,1,4,6,9]
Explanation: The tree structure remains unchanged after serialization and deserialization.
```

```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: [1,null,2]
Explanation: The tree structure remains unchanged after serialization and deserialization.
```

```
Input: root = [2,1,7]
Output: [2,1,7]
Explanation: The tree structure remains unchanged after serialization and deserialization.
```

### Constraints

- 1 <= Number of nodes <= 10,000
- 1 <= `TreeNode.val` <= 1,000,000
