# Minimum Meeting Rooms Needed

`#Medium` `#55mins`

Given an array of meeting time `intervals`, where each interval is represented as `[start, end]` which represents a meeting starting at time `start` and ending at time `end`, determine the minimum number of meeting rooms required to accommodate all the meetings without any overlap.

### Input

- `intervals: Array<[number, number]>`: An array of integers pairs

### Examples

```
Input: intervals = [[83,99]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Since there is only one meeting, only one room is required. There is no overlap, so just one room can accommodate the meeting.
```

```
Input: intervals = [[1,5],[2,6],[8,9]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two overlapping meetings: [1, 5] and [2, 6]. To accommodate both meetings simultaneously, at least two rooms are needed. The other meeting [8, 9] do not overlap with the earlier ones, so only two rooms are required in total.
```

```
Input: intervals = [[5,10],[10,15],[15,20]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The meetings are back-to-back, meaning they do not overlap. Since the end of one meeting coincides with the start of the next, only one room is sufficient to host all the meetings.
```

### Constraints

- 0 <= `intervals.length` <= 1000
- `intervals[i].length` == 2
- 0 <= `start` < `end` <= 1,000,000
