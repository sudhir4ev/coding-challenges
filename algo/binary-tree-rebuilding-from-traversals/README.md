# Binary Tree Rebuilding from Preorder and Inorder Traversals

`#Medium` `#45mins`

Given two arrays of integers, `preorder` and `inorder`, where `preorder` represents the values of a preorder traversal of a binary tree, and `inorder` represents the values of an inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree from these traversals.

### Input

- `preorder: number[]`: An array of positive integers
- `inorder: number[]`: An array of positive integers

### Examples

```
Input: preorder = [3,1,2,6,5,9], inorder = [1,2,3,5,6,9]
Output: [3,1,6,null,2,5,9]
Explanation: The root is 3, with left subtree [1, 2] and right subtree [6, 5, 9].
```

```
Input: preorder = [1,2,3], inorder = [3,2,1]
Output: [1,2,null,3]
Explanation: The root is 1, with left subtree [2, 3] and no right subtree.
```

```
Input: preorder = [7], inorder = [7]
Output: [7]
Explanation: The tree consists of a single node with the value 7, which is both the root and the only node.
```

### Constraints

- 1 <= Number of nodes <= 1000
- 1 <= `TreeNode.val` <= 1,000,000
- preorder and inorder contain unique values
