# Distinct Paths in Grid

`#Medium` `#35mins` `#Grids` `#DynamicProgramming`

A robot is situated on an `m` x `n` grid, starting at the top-left corner (`grid[0][0]`) with the goal of reaching the bottom-right corner (`grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). In one step, the robot can only either move down or right by a single cell.

Given the integers `m` and `n`, determine the number of distinct paths the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

### Input

- `m: number`: An integer
- `n: number`: An integer

### Examples

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The robot has 3 unique paths to reach the target point in a 3x2 grid: Right-Down-Down, Down-Down-Right, Down-Right-Down.
```

```
Input: m = 5, n = 7
Output: 210
Explanation: The robot can navigate a 5x7 grid using 210 unique paths to reach the target point.
```

```
Input: m = 10, n = 4
Output: 220
Explanation: The robot can navigate a 10x4 grid using 220 unique paths to reach the target point.
```

### Constraints

- The result will not exceed 2^31
- 1 <= `m`, `n` <= 100
