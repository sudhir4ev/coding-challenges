# Array Product Excluding Current

`#Medium` `#15mins`
Given an array of integers `numbers`, return a new array `result` where each element `result[i]` represents the product of all the elements in `numbers` except for `numbers[i]`.

### Input
- `numbers: number[]`: An array of integers

### Notes
- The product of any prefix or suffix of the `numbers` array is ensured to fit within a 32-bit integer
- Use of the division operator is prohibited

### Examples

```
Input: numbers = [1,2,3]
Output: [6,3,2]
Explanation: Output is multiplication of all other elements except self, i.e 2*3, 1*3, 1*2
```
```
Input: numbers = [2,0,3]
Output: [0,6,0]
Explanation: Output is multiplication of all other elements except self, i.e 0*3, 2*3, 2*0
```
```
Input: numbers = [0,0,-1,1]
Output: [0,0,0,0]
Explanation: Output is multiplication of all other elements except self, i.e 0*-1*1, 0*-1*1, 0*0*1, 0*0*-1
```

### Constraints
- 2 <= `numbers.length` <= 1000
- -10 <= `numbers[i]` <= 10
