# Course Dependency

`#Medium` `#40mins` `#Graphs` `#TopologicalSort`

There are a set of courses numbered from `0` to `courses - 1`. Each course may have prerequisites that dictate the order in which the courses must be taken. These prerequisites are given as a list of pairs, where each pair `[a, b]` indicates that course `b` must be completed before course `a`.

Determine if it is possible to complete all courses without violating any prerequisite constraints. Return `true` if it is possible to complete all the courses; otherwise, return `false`.

### Input

- `courses: number`: An integer representing the total number of courses
- `prerequisites: Array<[number, number]>`: A 2D array where each element `[a, b]` indicates that course `b` is a prerequisite for course `a`

### Examples

```
Input: courses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,2],[1,3]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are 4 courses labeled from 0 to 3. The prerequisite relationships are as follows: course 1 requires course 0 to be completed first, course 2 requires course 1, course 3 requires course 2, and course 1 requires course 3. This creates a circular dependency: course 1 depends on course 3, which in turn depends on course 2, which then depends on course 1 again. Since it is impossible to break this cycle and complete all courses, the output is false.
```

```
Input: courses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: The prerequisite [1, 0] indicates that course 0 must be completed before course 1. Since there are no other dependencies or cycles, it is straightforward to complete the courses in the order: course 0, then course 1. Therefore, the output is true.
```

### Constraints

- 1 <= `courses` <= 1000
- 0 <= `prerequisites.length` <= 1000
- `prerequisites[i].length` == 2
- 0 <= `a`, `b` < courses
- All pairs `[a, b]` in `prerequisites` are unique
