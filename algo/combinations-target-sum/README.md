# Combinations for Target Sum

`#Medium` `#40mins` `#DynamicProgramming` `#Backtracking`

Given a list of unique integers `numbers` and an integer `target`, find the number of different combinations of elements from `numbers` that sum up to target.

### Input

- `numbers: number[]`: An array of integers
- `target: number`: An integer

### Notes

- Test cases are chosen to guarantee the output falls within the limits of a 32-bit integer
- Combinations that consist of the same elements but differ in order are considered distinct

### Examples

```
Input: numbers = [1,2,3], target = 4
Output: 7
Explanation: The possible combinations are: (1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
```

```
Input: numbers = [7], target = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no combination of elements in [7] that can add up to 2.
```

```
Input: numbers = [2,4], target = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: The possible combinations are: (2, 2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
```

### Constraints

- 1 <= `numbers.length` <= 200
- 1 <= `numbers[i]` <= 1000
- 1 <= `target` <= 1000
- All the elements of numbers are unique
