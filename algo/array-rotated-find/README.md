# Find Element in Rotated Array

`#Medium` `#30mins`

Given a sorted and rotated array `numbers` containing unique elements and an integer `target`, return the index of `target` if it is in numbers, or `-1` if it is not.

Rotating an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` once results in `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`. Rotating it a second time results in `[a[n-2], a[n-1], a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-3]]`.

Develop an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time complexity.

#### Input
- `numbers: number[]`: An array of integers
- `target`: number: An integer

#### Notes

### Examples

```
Input: numbers = [0,1,2,3,4], target = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: The original array [0,1,2,3,4] was rotated 0 times and 2 is present at 2nd index in given array
```
```
Input: numbers = [2,3,4,0,1], target = 0
Output: 3
Explanation: The original array [0,1,2,3,4] was rotated 3 times and became [2,3,4,0,1]. 0 is present at 3rd index in given array
```
```
Input: numbers = [4], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: The original array [4] was rotated 0 times and became [4]. 2 is not present in the given array
```

#### Constraints
- 1 <= `numbers.length` <= 1000
- -10,000 <= `numbers[i]` <= 10,000
- -10,000 <= `target` <= 10,000
