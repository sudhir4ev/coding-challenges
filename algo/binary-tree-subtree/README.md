# Binary Tree Subtree

`#Easy` `#35mins`

Given the roots of two binary trees, `root` and `subRoot`, determine whether `subRoot` is a subtree of `root`. The function should return `true` if there exists a subtree within `root` that has the same structure and node values as `subRoot`. If no such subtree exists, return `false`.

The binary tree is represented by a collection of `TreeNode`s, where each node has optional `left` and `right` child nodes, which are also `TreeNode`s.

A `TreeNode` has the following interface:

```ts
interface TreeNode {
  val: number;
  left: TreeNode | null;
  right: TreeNode | null;
}
```

A subtree of a binary tree is defined as a portion of the tree that consists of a node and all its descendants. Subtrees have the following properties:

1. **Matching structure**: For `subRoot` to be a subtree of `root`, the nodes in `subRoot` must match the nodes in the corresponding portion of `root` both in value and structure.
2. **Self-containment**: A tree is always considered a subtree of itself.

### Input

- `root: TreeNode`: Root node of the tree. Examples display a level-order traversal of the tree
- `subRoot: TreeNode`: Root node of the subtree. Examples display a level-order traversal of the tree

### Examples

```
Input: root = [1,2,3], subRoot = [1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: SubRoot cannot be a subtree since the root node structure differs.
```

```
Input: root = [12,8,6,3,5], subRoot = [8,3,5]
Output: true
Explanation: The subtree rooted at node 8 matches subRoot.
```

```
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,null,5,1], subRoot = [11,7,2,5,1]
Output: true
Explanation: The subtree rooted at node 11 matches subRoot.
```

### Constraints

- 1 <= Number of nodes <= 100
- -10,000 <= `TreeNode.val` <= 10,000
