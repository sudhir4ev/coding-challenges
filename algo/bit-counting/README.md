# Bit Counting

`#Easy` `#25mins`

Given a non-negative integer `n`, write a function that takes the non-negative integer `n` 
and return an array `result` of size `n + 1` where `result[i]` represents the number of 
active bits (set bits to 1) in the binary representation of the integer `i` (where 0 <= `i` <= `n`).

### Input

- `n: number`: An integer

### Examples

```
Input: n = 1
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: The number of set bits in 0 (binary: 0) is 0, and in 1 (binary: 1) is 1.
```

```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation: The number of set bits in 0 (binary: 0) is 0, in 1 (binary: 1) is 1, and in 2 (binary: 10) is 1.
```

```
Input: n = 3
Output: [0,1,1,2]
Explanation: The number of set bits in 0 (binary: 0) is 0, in 1 (binary: 1) is 1, in 2 (binary: 10) is 1, and in 3 (binary: 11) is 2.
```

### Constraints

- 0 <= `n` <= 10,000
