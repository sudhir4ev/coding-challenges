# Graph Count Connected Components

`#Medium` `#45mins` `#Graphs` `#DepthFirstSearch` `#UnionFind`

Consider a graph with `num` nodes, labeled from `0` to `num - 1`. Given `num` and a list of edges where each `edges[i] = [a, b]` represents an undirected connection between nodes `a` and `b`, determine the number of connected components in the graph.

In the context of a graph, a component of an undirected graph is a connected subgraph that is not part of any larger connected subgraph.

### Input

- `num: number`: An integer, the number of nodes in the graph
- `edges: Array<[number, number]>`: A 2D array where `edges[i] = [a, b]` represents an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`

### Examples

```
Input: num = 6, edges = [[0,1],[4,5],[2,4],[1,3],[0,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation: All nodes are connected.
```

```
Input: num = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation: All nodes are connected.
```

```
Input: num = 4, edges = [[0,1],[2,3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two connected components: {0, 1} and {2, 3}.
```

### Constraints

- 1 <= `num` <= 1000
- 1 <= `edges.length` <= 2000
- `edges[i].length` == 2
- 0 <= `a` < `b` < `num`
- `a != b`
- There are no self-loops or duplicate edges
