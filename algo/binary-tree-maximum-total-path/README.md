# Binary Tree Maximum Total Path

`#Hard` `#40mins`

Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine the maximum possible sum of any non-empty path within the tree.

In a binary tree, a path is defined as a sequence of nodes where each consecutive pair of nodes in the sequence is directly connected by an edge. A node can appear in the path sequence only once, and the path does not necessarily need to include the root. The sum of a path is calculated by adding up the values of all nodes present in that path.

The binary tree is represented by a collection of `TreeNode`s, where each node has optional `left` and `right` child nodes, which are also `TreeNode`s.

A `TreeNode` has the following interface:

```ts
interface TreeNode {
  val: number;
  left: TreeNode | null;
  right: TreeNode | null;
}
```

### Input

- `root: TreeNode`: Root node of the tree. Examples display a level-order traversal of the tree

### Examples

```
Input: root = [4,3,5]
Output: 12
Explanation: The optimal path is 3 -> 4 -> 5 with a sum of 12.
```

```
Input: root = [-2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The optimal path is the single node with value 1.
```

```
Input: root = [-30,8,22,null,null,17,8]
Output: 47
Explanation: The optimal path is 17 -> 22 -> 8 with a sum of 47.
```

### Constraints

- 1 <= Number of nodes <= 10,000
- -100 <= `TreeNode.val` <= 100
