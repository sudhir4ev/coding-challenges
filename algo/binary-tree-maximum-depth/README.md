# Binary Tree Maximum Depth

`#Easy` `#20mins`

Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine the depth of the tree, which is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root to the most distant leaf node.

The binary tree is represented by a collection of `TreeNode`s, where each node has optional `left` and `right` child nodes, which are also `TreeNode`s.

A `TreeNode` has the following interface:

```ts
interface TreeNode {
  val: number;
  left: TreeNode | null;
  right: TreeNode | null;
}
```

### Input

- `root: TreeNode`: Root node of the tree. Examples display a level-order traversal of the tree

### Examples

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The tree has a maximum depth of 3. The longest path from root (1) to leaves (4, 5, 6, or 7) is of length 3.
```

```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: The tree has a maximum depth of 2. The longest path from root (1) to leaf (2) is of length 2.
```

```
Input: root = [10,5,15,null,null,12,20]
Output: 3
Explanation: The tree has a maximum depth of 3. The longest path from root (10) to leaves (12 or 20) is of length 3.
```

### Constraints

- 1 <= Number of nodes <= 10,000
- -100 <= `TreeNode.val` <= 100
