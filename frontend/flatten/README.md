# Flatten

How to flatten an array in JavaScript
If you just need to flatten an array in production code, use the built-in Array.prototype.flat:

```ts
const nested = [1, [2, [3, [4, [5]]]]];

// Flatten one level (the default).
nested.flat(); // [1, 2, [3, [4, [5]]]]

// Flatten a specific number of levels.
nested.flat(2); // [1, 2, 3, [4, [5]]]

// Flatten all levels by passing Infinity.
nested.flat(Infinity); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```


`Array.flat` is part of ES2019 and is supported in every evergreen browser and Node.js 11+. It returns a new array and does not mutate the original.

When `Array.flat` **isn't enough**
`Array.flat` covers the standard case. You'll need a custom flatten when you need any of the following:

- **Skip-flattening certain values**, for example keeping `Buffer`-like objects or typed arrays intact while flattening plain arrays.
- **Flattening trees of objects** rather than arrays, such as nested children in a tree node structure.
- **Iterative flattening** to avoid recursion limits when the nesting depth is unknown and potentially adversarial.
- **Lazy flattening** with a generator when the result is large and you only need part of it.

For all of those, you'll write your own `flatten`. This is also one of the most common JavaScript interview questions because it tests recursion, type checking, and array manipulation in a small surface area.

Implement a function flatten that returns a newly-created array with all sub-array elements concatenated recursively into a single level.

Examples
```ts
// Single-level arrays are unaffected.
flatten([1, 2, 3]); // [1, 2, 3]

// Inner arrays are flattened into a single level.
flatten([1, [2, 3]]); // [1, 2, 3]
flatten([
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4],
]); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Flattens recursively.
flatten([1, [2, [3, [4, [5]]]]]); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
